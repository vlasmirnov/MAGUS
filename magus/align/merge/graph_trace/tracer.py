'''
Graph clusters must be refined into a "trace", a constrained clustering that corresponds to a valid MSA.
There are a variety of ways to do this, "minclusters" is usually the most dependable option.
"mwtgreedy" or "rgfast" might be used if there are scalability issues.
Some of these options don't require an existing clustering, and can work on the raw graph.
